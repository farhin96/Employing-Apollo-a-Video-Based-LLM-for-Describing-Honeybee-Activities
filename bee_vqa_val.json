  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/100_2_Signaling.mp4",
    "question": "What behavior are the bees showing in this clip?",
    "answer": "The bees are showing clear signaling behavior. One bee raises its abdomen and extends its proboscis toward another bee, which often indicates communication through pheromones or trophallactic-sharing signals. They move closely face-to-face, suggesting that one bee is transmitting information, scent cues, or food droplets to the other."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/100_2_Signaling.mp4",
    "question": "Describe in detail what the bees are doing.",
    "answer": "Two bees are interacting directly, with one bee extending its proboscis and leaning toward the head of the other. This is typical signaling behavior—either trophallaxis or chemical communication. Their slow, deliberate movements and close face-to-face contact show that information or food is being exchanged, not aggression or grooming."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/100_2_Signaling.mp4",
    "question": "Is this fanning, grooming, or signaling?",
    "answer": "This is signaling. The bees are not vibrating their wings or cleaning each other. Instead, one bee is deliberately extending its mouthparts toward another bee's head, which is characteristic of pheromone-based communication or a trophallaxis-style exchange."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/100_2_Signaling.mp4",
    "question": "What is the main activity happening here?",
    "answer": "The main activity is bee-to-bee signaling. One bee is presenting its proboscis to another in a communicative posture. This behavior often appears when bees share chemical cues, food droplets, or colony information."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/100_2_Signaling.mp4",
    "question": "Explain what clues indicate this is signaling behavior.",
    "answer": "The extended proboscis, the face-to-face alignment, and the absence of wing motion or body cleaning indicate signaling behavior. Fanning would show rapid wing vibration, and grooming would show leg scratching or body cleaning movements. Here, the bees interact with slow, intentional head-to-head contact, which matches communication or trophallaxis signaling."
