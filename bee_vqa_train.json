    "question": "What type of bee is mostly visible in this video?",
    "answer": "The video mostly shows a drone bee. It is larger than worker bees, has a bulkier abdomen, and big rounded eyes that meet at the top of the head, which are typical drone characteristics."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/37_2_Drone.mp4",
    "question": "Describe what the drone bee is doing in this clip.",
    "answer": "The drone bee is walking calmly across the comb surface. It is not collecting nectar or pollen; instead, it is simply moving around the hive, a normal behavior since drones do not gather resources but mainly eat and stay inside until mating flights."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/37_2_Drone.mp4",
    "question": "How do you know this is a drone bee?",
    "answer": "The bee has a very large and rounded body, oversized eyes that almost touch at the top, and a thick abdomen. It also lacks pollen baskets. These are key features that distinguish drones from worker bees."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/37_2_Drone.mp4",
    "question": "What is the main behavior happening in the video?",
    "answer": "A drone bee is slowly roaming on the comb. There is no foraging or fanning happening. Drones mainly wander around inside the hive, feed themselves, and wait for an opportunity to join a mating flight."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/37_2_Drone.mp4",
    "question": "Is this a worker bee or a drone bee? Explain why.",
    "answer": "It is a drone bee. You can tell because its eyes are extremely large, its body is thicker and heavier, and it does not have pollen baskets. Worker bees are slimmer with smaller eyes and more active in tasks like cleaning or carrying pollen."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/37_2_Drone.mp4",
    "question": "What role does the bee in this video play in the colony?",
    "answer": "The bee is a drone, whose main purpose in the colony is reproduction. Drones leave the hive for mating flights, but inside the hive they typically walk around, eat, and rest, as seen in this video."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/37_2_Drone.mp4",
    "question": "Explain the behavior and body posture seen in this clip.",
    "answer": "The drone bee is calmly moving around with a slow and heavy walking motion, which is typical of drones. It does not show the fast, purposeful movement of worker bees. The posture is relaxed and non-aggressive."

  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/7_3_Fanning.mp4",
    "question": "Why are the bees moving their wings so fast while staying almost in the same spot?",
    "answer": "The bees are fanning: by rapidly beating their wings without flying away, they create airflow that cools the hive and helps evaporate moisture from nectar."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/7_3_Fanning.mp4",
    "question": "What behavior is shown when bees’ wings look blurred from motion but they don’t leave the hive entrance?",
    "answer": "That wing blur with the bees staying fixed at the entrance is a clear sign of fanning behavior to ventilate the hive, not flight or foraging."
  },
  {
    "video": "C:/Users/Windows/aploo/data/bees/videos/7_3_Fanning.mp4",
    "question": "Explain the purpose of the bees’ wing movement in this scene.",
