# Employing-Apollo-a-Video-Based-LLM-for-Describing-Honeybee-Activities
This project combines OpenCV-based visual cues with a fine-tuned Apollo-3B multimodal model to analyze honey-bee behavior from video. Computer vision provides a stable behavior label, while the model generates grounded explanations. A Gradio interface enables interactive video-based querying.
